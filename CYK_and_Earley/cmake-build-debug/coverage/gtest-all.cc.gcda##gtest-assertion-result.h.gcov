        -:   54:// A class for indicating whether an assertion was successful.  When
        -:   55:// the assertion wasn't successful, the AssertionResult object
        -:   56:// remembers a non-empty message that describes how it failed.
        -:   57://
        -:   58:// To create an instance of this class, use one of the factory functions
        -:   59:// (AssertionSuccess() and AssertionFailure()).
        -:   60://
        -:   61:// This class is useful for two purposes:
        -:   62://   1. Defining predicate functions to be used with Boolean test assertions
        -:   63://      EXPECT_TRUE/EXPECT_FALSE and their ASSERT_ counterparts
        -:   64://   2. Defining predicate-format functions to be
        -:   65://      used with predicate assertions (ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT*, etc).
        -:   66://
        -:   67:// For example, if you define IsEven predicate:
        -:   68://
        -:   69://   testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
        -:   70://     if ((n % 2) == 0)
        -:   71://       return testing::AssertionSuccess();
        -:   72://     else
        -:   73://       return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
        -:   74://   }
        -:   75://
        -:   76:// Then the failed expectation EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(Fib(5)))
        -:   77:// will print the message
        -:   78://
        -:   79://   Value of: IsEven(Fib(5))
        -:   80://     Actual: false (5 is odd)
        -:   81://   Expected: true
        -:   82://
        -:   83:// instead of a more opaque
        -:   84://
        -:   85://   Value of: IsEven(Fib(5))
        -:   86://     Actual: false
        -:   87://   Expected: true
        -:   88://
        -:   89:// in case IsEven is a simple Boolean predicate.
        -:   90://
        -:   91:// If you expect your predicate to be reused and want to support informative
        -:   92:// messages in EXPECT_FALSE and ASSERT_FALSE (negative assertions show up
        -:   93:// about half as often as positive ones in our tests), supply messages for
        -:   94:// both success and failure cases:
        -:   95://
        -:   96://   testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
        -:   97://     if ((n % 2) == 0)
        -:   98://       return testing::AssertionSuccess() << n << " is even";
        -:   99://     else
        -:  100://       return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
        -:  101://   }
        -:  102://
        -:  103:// Then a statement EXPECT_FALSE(IsEven(Fib(6))) will print
        -:  104://
        -:  105://   Value of: IsEven(Fib(6))
        -:  106://     Actual: true (8 is even)
        -:  107://   Expected: false
        -:  108://
        -:  109:// NB: Predicates that support negative Boolean assertions have reduced
        -:  110:// performance in positive ones so be careful not to use them in tests
        -:  111:// that have lots (tens of thousands) of positive Boolean assertions.
        -:  112://
        -:  113:// To use this class with EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT assertions such as:
        -:  114://
        -:  115://   // Verifies that Foo() returns an even number.
        -:  116://   EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEven, Foo());
        -:  117://
        -:  118:// you need to define:
        -:  119://
        -:  120://   testing::AssertionResult IsEven(const char* expr, int n) {
        -:  121://     if ((n % 2) == 0)
        -:  122://       return testing::AssertionSuccess();
        -:  123://     else
        -:  124://       return testing::AssertionFailure()
        -:  125://         << "Expected: " << expr << " is even\n  Actual: it's " << n;
        -:  126://   }
        -:  127://
        -:  128:// If Foo() returns 5, you will see the following message:
        -:  129://
        -:  130://   Expected: Foo() is even
        -:  131://     Actual: it's 5
